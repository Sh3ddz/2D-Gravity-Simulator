# 2D-Gravity-Simulator
A 2 dimensional gravity simulator in Java


## Controls:
- WASD or ARROW KEYS - Move the camera
- MOUSEBUTTON1 - Place a Planet entity object, hold for larger objects and aim in the direction you want the initial velocity to be.
- MOUSEBUTTON2 - Place a Star entity object, hold for larger objects and aim in the direction you want the initial velocity to be.
- MOUSEBUTTON3 - Place a BlackHole entity object, hold for larger objects and aim in the direction you want the initial velocity to be.
- R - Resets the simulaton (removes everything and resets camera)
- T - Draws trails behind entities (currently just planets)
- P - Pauses the simulation
- TAB - centers the camera on an entity, hit multiple times to cycle through (currently no way to unlock the camera other than resetting)
- F3 - Debug mode, shows vectors + masses + velocity of the entities as well as important information in the top left.
